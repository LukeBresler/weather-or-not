Here’s a solid and professional README.md template for your weather app GitHub repository, with emphasis on your recent refactor using SOLID principles. You can copy and edit it to suit your tone and exact project details:

# WeatherApp

A clean, modular weather app built for a tech assessment. Originally a basic MVP, it has since been refactored to align with **SOLID principles** for better scalability, testability, and maintainability.

## ✨ Features

- Current weather data by city
- Search functionality
- Location-based weather (if permissions granted)
- Clean and responsive UI
- Error handling and loading states

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Swift
- **Architecture**: MVVM
- **Networking**: URLSession / Custom APIClient
- **UI**: UIKit / SwiftUI (update if relevant)
- **Other**: CoreLocation, UserDefaults

## ✅ SOLID Refactor Overview

The app was recently refactored with a strong emphasis on SOLID design principles:

- **S**: Single Responsibility Principle  
  Each class/component has one clearly defined responsibility.
  
- **O**: Open/Closed Principle  
  New features or behavior can be added with minimal changes to existing code.
  
- **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle  
  Protocol-based design ensures interchangeable components.
  
- **I**: Interface Segregation Principle  
  Protocols are split into focused, smaller contracts.
  
- **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle  
  High-level modules do not depend on low-level ones—both depend on abstractions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weatherapp.git

	2.	Open in Xcode:

open WeatherApp.xcodeproj


	3.	Run on a simulator or device.
	4.	To use live weather data, insert your API key in the appropriate config file:

let apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY"



🧪 Testing

Includes unit tests for core components (API client, ViewModels).
Designed for easy mocking and extension.

📌 Notes
	•	Built as part of a tech assessment.
	•	Refactored independently to demonstrate proficiency in clean architecture and SOLID principles.
